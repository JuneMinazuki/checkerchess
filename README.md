# Checker Chess â™›
Checkers Chess is a unique two-player board game that blends the classic mechanics of checkers and chess into a single, balanced experience.

The game pits a set of checkers pieces against a set of chess pieces, each with modified rules designed to create a fair and strategic competition:

1. The primary objective for the checkers player is to capture all of the opponent's chess pieces
2. A "void zone" is integrated into the board's layout, which only checkers pieces can enter
3. Standard checkers pieces move forward or diagonally, promoted checkers pieces can move in all eight cardinal directions (vertically, horizontally and diagonally)
4. The four checker pieces on back row begin the game already promoted

The chess pieces operate under their traditional movement rules, but with the modified objective of protecting their fellow pieces until the checkers player's army is eliminated. This creates a fresh strategic challenge for both sides.
